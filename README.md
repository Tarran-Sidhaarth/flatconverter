## What is Buffman?

Buffman is your friendly neighborhood CLI tool that wraps around the mighty `flatc` compiler. It makes converting Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) files into FlatBuffers (`.fbs`) a breeze ‚Äî no more wrestling with complicated commands! Plus, with a powerful YAML config (`buffman.yml`), you can automate conversions and code generation effortlessly.

And guess what? We‚Äôre just getting started! Soon, Buffman will support more buffer formats like Nanobuffers and beyond. Stay tuned!

---

## Getting Started

Install Buffman, create your `buffman.yml` config, and you're ready to roll. Whether you want to convert proto files or generate language-specific code, Buffman‚Äôs got your back.

## Buffman Commands

### buffman (root command)

The heart of Buffman! Run this command with your config file (default: `buffman.yml`) and it will execute all the conversions and generations you‚Äôve defined. No need to run multiple commands manually ‚Äî just one command to rule them all!


### convert

Want to transform your `.proto` files into `.fbs`? The `convert` command is your go-to. It supports converting proto files to FlatBuffers schemas with ease.

For a deep dive into usage, flags, and examples, check out the detailed guide:  
[docs/convert.md](docs/convert.md)

### generate

Ready to turn your `.fbs` schemas into language-specific source files? The `generate` command lets you generate code in Go, C++, Java, Kotlin, and more ‚Äî all configurable via your YAML file.

Explore all the nitty-gritty details here:  
[docs/generate.md](docs/generate.md)

## Configuration

Buffman uses a YAML configuration file (`buffman.yml`) to define your conversion and generation workflows. This makes it easy to automate complex pipelines without breaking a sweat.
